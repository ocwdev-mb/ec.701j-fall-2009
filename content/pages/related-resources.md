D-Lab Technology Resources
--------------------------

_\[Please note: this content was obtained from the_ [_D-Lab Resources_](http://d-lab.mit.edu/resources-publications) _page on December 12, 2011. Users are encouraged to check that page for later updates.\]_

Learn how to build and use D-Lab technologies! Whether you are working with a community that will greatly benefit from adopting these technologies, or you want to learn new building skills, or you want to set up a workshop to disseminate these innovations, here you will find all the materials that you will need:

*   **Background Notes**: Contextual information about the challenges being addressed, history of technology development, and project deployment status.
*   **Build-It Modules**: For students to learn basic shop skills while building a practical technology that can be disseminated in the field. Also comes in a version with teaching notes to provide more insight into the technology and guide the teacher/facilitator.
*   **Do-It Modules**: For making and disseminating D-Lab innovations. Uses minimal text and simple black & white drawings to facilitate translation, printing, distribution and implementation in the field. To help the documents last longer, we recommend laminating them or using sheet protectors.

### Charcoal

These documents describe the tools and processes needed to make charcoal from agricultural waste, which provides a clean-burning, environmentally-friendly alternative to wood charcoal.

*   Charcoal Background Notes ({{% resource_link 6fe20192-17e6-001d-dd86-7bd1b3f7da6f "PDF - 1.3MB" %}})
*   Charcoal Press Built-It ({{% resource_link 3f9b30e8-b2d8-afa8-9131-3ce136f121f5 "PDF" %}})
