### Current Events

Review both the national and international media to find a story that affects your D-Lab project country. Some sectors that might be of interest include: the environment, health and sanitation, agriculture, energy, education, humanitarian disaster, politics, economics and information technology. Each person on your D-Lab country team should select a different topic. Write a 2-page summary of the story making sure to comment on its implications for the nation, your D-Lab trip or another affected group. Make sure to properly cite all your sources.

Hand this summary in to your trip leader at your first country team meeting. The goal of this exercise is to learn as much as possible about your country's current status. You should prepare a brief (5-minute) presentation for D-Lab Team to be given in your first country team meeting.
